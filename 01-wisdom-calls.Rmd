# The Woman Named *Wisdom* Calls Out

## *Proverbs 8:1-5*

Doesn’t wisdom cry out?
Doesn’t understanding raise her voice?
On the top of high places by the way,
where the paths meet, she stands.
Beside the gates, at the entry of the city,
at the entry doors, she cries aloud:
“I call to you men!
I send my voice to the sons of mankind.
You simple, understand prudence!
You fools, be of an understanding heart!

**Questions to consider**

- What is Wisdom doing? Why?
- Where is she calling out?
- Who is she calling out to?
- What does *naive* mean?
  - *(of a person or action) showing a lack of experience, wisdom, or judgment*
- What does *prudence* mean?
  - *acting with or showing care and thought for the future*

This year Daddy wants to study the Proverbs together. Why? Because I want you children to be wise and not foolish. A wise man or woman will be protected and will be a blessing to everyone around him. But a foolish man will destroy himself and the people closest to him. 

God has given us this book of Proverbs to teach us how to be wise. So we should read it and study it carefully.

## *Proverbs 8:6-11*

Hear, for I will speak excellent things.
The opening of my lips is for right things.
For my mouth speaks truth.
Wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
All the words of my mouth are in righteousness.
There is nothing crooked or perverse in them.
They are all plain to him who understands,
right to those who find knowledge.
Receive my instruction rather than silver,
knowledge rather than choice gold.
For wisdom is better than rubies.
All the things that may be desired can’t be compared to it.

**Questions to consider**

- Why do we have to be told to listen? Do we like to hear the truth?
- Can you be good without telling the truth? Can you tell the truth and be wicked?
- What is the difference between wisdom and knowledge?
- How valuable is the truth? How valuable is wisdom?

We must be exhorted to listen because we don't want to. We like to tell ourselves lies, and we often like to listen to other people tell us lies. Some people whant to separate goodness from truthfulness. They say you can speak lies but still be good. That's a lie. God is Righteous **and** True. There is no separating those two characteristics with Him.
