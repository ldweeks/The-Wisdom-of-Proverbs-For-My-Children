# The Woman Named *Wisdom* Calls Out

## *Proverbs 8:1-5*

Does not wisdom call,  
And understanding lift up her voice?  
On top of the heights beside the way,  
Where the paths meet, she takes her stand;  
Beside the gates, at the opening to the city,  
At the entrance of the doors, she cries out:  
“To you, O men, I call,  
And my voice is to the sons of men.  
“O naive ones, understand prudence;  
And, O fools, understand wisdom.  

**Questions to consider**

- What is Wisdom doing? Why?
- Where is she calling out?
- Who is she calling out to?
- What does *naive* mean?
  - *(of a person or action) showing a lack of experience, wisdom, or judgment*
- What does *prudence* mean?
  - *acting with or showing care and thought for the future*

This year Daddy wants to study the Proverbs together. Why? Because I want you children to be wise and not foolish. A wise man or woman will be protected and will be a blessing to everyone around him. But a foolish man will destroy himself and the people closest to him. 

God has given us this book of Proverbs to teach us how to be wise. So we should read it and study it carefully.

## *Proverbs 8:6-11*

“Listen, for I will speak noble things;  
And the opening of my lips will reveal right things.  
“For my mouth will utter truth;  
And wickedness is an abomination to my lips.  
“All the utterances of my mouth are in righteousness;  
There is nothing crooked or perverted in them.  
“They are all straightforward to him who understands,  
And right to those who find knowledge.  
“Take my instruction and not silver,  
And knowledge rather than choicest gold.  
“For wisdom is better than jewels;  
And all desirable things cannot compare with her.  

**Questions to consider**

- Why do we have to be told to listen? Do we like to hear the truth?
- Can you be good without telling the truth? Can you tell the truth and be wicked?
- What is the difference between wisdom and knowledge?
- How valuable is the truth? How valuable is wisdom?

We must be exhorted to listen because we don't want to. We like to tell ourselves lies, and we often like to listen to other people tell us lies. Some people whant to separate goodness from truthfulness. They say you can speak lies but still be good. That's a lie. God is Righteous **and** True. There is no separating those two characteristics with Him.
